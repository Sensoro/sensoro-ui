Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that is rapidly growing in popularity and there are many plugins that can boost your workflow and make your life easier.

**Let's begin!**

### How to install Tailwind CSS plugins?

Installing Tailwind CSS plugins is easy.

1. First you install the package. For example to install daisyUI plugin, you run:

```
npm i daisyui
```

2. Then you add the plugin to `tailwind.config.js` file in `plugins` array:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [require("daisyui")],
}
```

### Here's the list of best Tailwind CSS plugins:

## 1. daisyUI

[daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) is a free component library for Tailwind CSS that adds component class names to Tailwind CSS.  
It helps you to build websites faster. daisyUI uses human-friendly and descriptive class names like `btn`, `card`, `toggle`, `alert`, `modal` etc. which helps you use less class names and keep your HTML clean.  
daisyUI also comes with a lot of built-in themes and dark mode support so you don't have to write any additional class names to enable dark mode. It works out of the box.

## 2. tailwindcss/typography

[tailwindcss/typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) is the official Tailwind CSS plugin that adds default styles for all your text content.  
 Typography plugin is made by the Tailwind CSS team and it's a must-have plugin for any Tailwind CSS project especially if you are building a blog or a website with a lot of text content. It plays well with Markdown content since all you have to do is to add `prose` class to your container and it will automatically style all your text content.

## 3. tailwindcss/container-queries

Another plugin from Tailwind team, [tailwindcss/container-queries](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins#container-queries) adds the new cool CSS feature called [container queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_container_queries) to Tailwind CSS. Container queries are similar to media queries but instead of checking the screen size, they check the size of the container. This is useful if you want to change the layout of your website based on the size of the container.

Container queries are [supported by all modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/css-container-query-units) and soon the class names will be added to Tailwind CSS core, but for now you can use this plugin to implement container queries in your project.

Otherwise it will have conflicts because both plugins add styles to the same elements.
